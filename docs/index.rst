Humus AMQP Module's Documentation
=================================

Documentation for `Humus AMQP Module
<http://www.github.com/prolic/HumusAmqpModule/>`_

The Humus AMQP Module incorporates messaging in your zf2 application via RabbitMQ using the PHP AMQP Extension.

This module implements several messaging patterns comparable to the `Thumper <https://github.com/videlalvaro/Thumper>`_ library.

A lot of ideas and even some implementation details came from the `RabbitMQ Java Client <https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client>`_ and the `RabbitMqBundle <https://github.com/videlalvaro/RabbitMqBundle>`_, special thanks to `Alvaro Videla <https://github.com/videlalvaro>`_ and the contributors of this project.

The documentation is based on the `Bunny documentation <http://rubybunny.info/>`_, texts and images are partly copied from there, special thanks to `Michael Klishin <https://github.com/michaelklishin>`_ for the permission to build on this work.
