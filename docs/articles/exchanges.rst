Exchanges and Producers
=======================

Exchanges in AMQP 0.9.1 â€” Overview
----------------------------------

What are AMQP exchanges?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An *exchange* accepts messages from a producer application and routes
them to message queues. They can be thought of as the "mailboxes" of the
AMQP world. Unlike some other messaging middleware products and
protocols, in AMQP, messages are *not* published directly to queues.
Messages are published to exchanges that route them to queue(s) using
pre-arranged criteria called *bindings*.

There are multiple exchange types in the AMQP 0.9.1 specification, each
with its own routing semantics. Custom exchange types can be created to
deal with sophisticated routing scenarios (e.g. routing based on
geolocation data or edge cases) or just for convenience.

Concept of Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *binding* is an association between a queue and an exchange. A queue
must be bound to at least one exchange in order to receive messages from
publishers. Learn more about bindings in the :ref:`Bindings Guide <Bindings>`.

Exchange attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exchanges have several attributes associated with them:

-  Name
-  Type (direct, fanout, topic, headers or some custom type)
-  Durability
-  Whether the exchange is auto-deleted when no longer used
-  Other metadata (sometimes known as *X-arguments*)

Exchange types
--------------

There are four built-in exchange types in AMQP v0.9.1:

-  Direct
-  Fanout
-  Topic
-  Headers

As stated previously, each exchange type has its own routing semantics
and new exchange types can be added by extending brokers with plugins.
Custom exchange types begin with "x-", much like custom HTTP headers,
e.g. `x-consistent-hash
exchange <https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange>`_
or `x-random exchange <https://github.com/jbrisbin/random-exchange>`_.

Message attributes
------------------

Before we start looking at various exchange types and their routing
semantics, we need to introduce message attributes. Every AMQP message
has a number of *attributes*. Some attributes are important and used
very often, others are rarely used. AMQP message attributes are metadata
and are similar in purpose to HTTP request and response headers.

Every AMQP 0.9.1 message has an attribute called *routing key*. The
routing key is an "address" that the exchange may use to decide how to
route the message. This is similar to, but more generic than, a URL in
HTTP. Most exchange types use the routing key to implement routing
logic, but some ignore it and use other criteria (e.g. message content).

Fanout exchanges
----------------

How fanout exchanges route messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues that are bound to
it and the routing key is ignored. If N queues are bound to a fanout
exchange, when a new message is published to that exchange a *copy of
the message* is delivered to all N queues. Fanout exchanges are ideal
for the `broadcast
routing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28computing%29>`_ of
messages.

Graphically this can be represented as:

   :align: center
   :alt: fanout exchange routing

   fanout exchange routing

Declaring a fanout exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can simply define an exchange in the module configuration.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'exchanges' => array(
                'myexchange' => array(
                    'name' => 'myexchange',
                    'type' => 'fanout'
                )
            )
        )
    );

Fanout use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because a fanout exchange delivers a copy of a message to every queue
bound to it, its use cases are quite similar:

-  Massively multiplayer online (MMO) games can use it for leaderboard
   updates or other global events
-  Sport news sites can use fanout exchanges for distributing score
   updates to mobile clients in near real-time
-  Distributed systems can broadcast various state and configuration
   updates
-  Group chats can distribute messages between participants using a
   fanout exchange (although AMQP does not have a built-in concept of
   presence, so `XMPP <http://xmpp.org>`_ may be a better choice)

Pre-declared fanout exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AMQP 0.9.1 brokers must implement a fanout exchange type and pre-declare
one instance with the name of ``"amq.fanout"``.

Applications can rely on that exchange always being available to them.
Each vhost has a separate instance of that exchange, it is *not shared
across vhosts* for obvious reasons.

Direct exchanges
----------------

How direct exchanges route messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on a *message
routing key*, an attribute that every AMQP v0.9.1 message contains.

Here is how it works:

-  A queue binds to the exchange with a routing key K
-  When a new message with routing key R arrives at the direct exchange,
   the exchange routes it to the queue if K = R

A direct exchange is ideal for the `unicast
routing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast>`_ of messages (although
they can be used for `multicast
routing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast>`_ as well).

Here is a graphical representation:

.. figure:: https://github.com/prolic/HumusAmqpModuleDocs/raw/master/diagrams/005_direct_exchange.png
   :align: center
   :alt: direct exchange routing

   direct exchange routing

Declaring a direct exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'exchanges' => array(
                'myexchange' => array(
                    'name' => 'myexchange',
                    'type' => 'direct'
                )
            )
        )
    );

Direct routing example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since direct exchanges use the *message routing key* for routing,
message producers need to specify it:

The routing key will then be compared for equality with routing keys on
bindings, and consumers that subscribed with the same routing key each
get a copy of the message.

Direct Exchanges and Load Balancing of Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct exchanges are often used to distribute tasks between multiple
workers (instances of the same application) in a round robin manner.
When doing so, it is important to understand that, in AMQP 0.9.1,
*messages are load balanced between consumers and not between queues*.

The :ref:`Queues and Consumers <queues>` guide provides more
information on this subject.

Pre-declared direct exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AMQP 0.9.1 brokers must implement a direct exchange type and pre-declare
two instances:

-  ``amq.direct``
-  *""* exchange known as *default exchange* (unnamed, referred to as an
   empty string)

Applications can rely on those exchanges always being available to them.
Each vhost has separate instances of those exchanges, they are *not
shared across vhosts* for obvious reasons.

Default exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default exchange is a direct exchange with no name pre-declared
by the broker. It has one special property that makes it very useful
for simple applications, namely that *every queue is automatically bound
to it with a routing key which is the same as the queue name*.

For example, when you declare a queue with the name of
"search.indexing.online", RabbitMQ will bind it to the default exchange
using "search.indexing.online" as the routing key. Therefore a message
published to the default exchange with routing key =
"search.indexing.online" will be routed to the queue
"search.indexing.online". In other words, the default exchange makes it
*seem like it is possible to deliver messages directly to queues*, even
though that is not technically what is happening.

Direct Exchange Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct exchanges can be used in a wide variety of cases:

-  Direct (near real-time) messages to individual players in an MMO game
-  Delivering notifications to specific geographic locations (for
   example, points of sale)
-  Distributing tasks between multiple instances of the same application
   all having the same function, for example, image processors
-  Passing data between workflow steps, each having an identifier (also
   consider using headers exchange)
-  Delivering notifications to individual software services in the
   network

Topic Exchanges
---------------

How Topic Exchanges Route Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topic exchanges route messages to one or many queues based on matching
between a message routing key and the pattern that was used to bind a
queue to an exchange. The topic exchange type is often used to implement
various `publish/subscribe
pattern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe>`_ variations.

Topic exchanges are commonly used for the `multicast
routing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast>`_ of messages.

.. figure:: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Multicast.svg/500px-Multicast.svg.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Topic exchanges can be used for `broadcast
routing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28computing%29>`_,
but fanout exchanges are usually more efficient for this use case.

Declaring a topic exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'exchanges' => array(
                'myexchange' => array(
                    'name' => 'myexchange',
                    'type' => 'topic',
                    'connection' => 'my_other_connection'
                )
            )
        )
    );

As you can see, you can also specify to which connection the exchange belongs to. If nothing is present,
the default connection will be used. You can set the default like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'default_connection' => 'my_other_connection'
        )
    );

Topic Exchange Routing Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two classic examples of topic-based routing are stock price updates and
location-specific data (for instance, weather broadcasts). Consumers
indicate which topics they are interested in (think of it like
subscribing to a feed for an individual tag of your favourite blog as
opposed to the full feed).

A routing pattern consists of several words separated by dots, in a
similar way to URI path segments being joined by slash. A few of
examples:

-  asia.southeast.thailand.bangkok
-  sports.basketball
-  usa.nasdaq.aapl
-  tasks.search.indexing.accounts

The following routing keys match the "americas.south.#" pattern:

-  americas.south
-  americas.south.\ *brazil*
-  americas.south.\ *brazil.saopaolo*
-  americas.south.\ *chile.santiago*

In other words, the "#" part of the pattern matches 0 or more words.

For the pattern "americas.south.\*", some matching routing keys are:

-  americas.south.\ *brazil*
-  americas.south.\ *chile*
-  americas.south.\ *peru*

but not

-  americas.south
-  americas.south.chile.santiago

As you can see, the "\*" part of the pattern matches 1 word only.

Topic Exchange Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topic exchanges have a very broad set of use cases. Whenever a problem
involves multiple consumers/applications that selectively choose which
type of messages they want to receive, the use of topic exchanges should
be considered. To name a few examples:

-  Distributing data relevant to specific geographic location, for
   example, points of sale
-  Background task processing done by multiple workers, each capable of
   handling specific set of tasks
-  Stocks price updates (and updates on other kinds of financial data)
-  News updates that involve categorization or tagging (for example,
   only for a particular sport or team)
-  Orchestration of services of different kinds in the cloud
-  Distributed architecture/OS-specific software builds or packaging
   where each builder can handle only one architecture or OS


Publishing messages
-------------------

To publish a message to an exchange, first we need a configured producer.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'exchanges' => array(
                'myexchange' => array(
                    'name' => 'myexchange',
                    'type' => 'topic',
                )
            ),
            'producers' => array(
                'my-producer' => array(
                    'exchange' => 'myexchange',
                    'auto_setup_fabric' => true
                )
            )
        )
    );


You define a producer name (my-producer) and tell to which exchange it should publish. Additionally
you can set "auto_setup_fabric" to true. This will automatically create the exchange if none is present.

To publish a message, get the producer plugin manager, get the producer and publish:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $pm = $serivceManager->get('HumusAmqpModule\PluginManager\Producer');
    $producer = $pm->get('my-producer');

    $producer->publish('foo', 'my.routing.key');

    $messages = array('foo', 'bar', 'baz');

    $producer->publishBatch($messages, 'my.routing.key');

The method accepts message body, a routing key and some message attributes.
Routing key can be blank (``""``) but never ``null``.
The body needs to be a string. The message payload is completely opaque
to the library and is not modified by Bunny or RabbitMQ in any way.

Data serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are encouraged to take care of data serialization before publishing
(i.e. by using JSON, Thrift, Protocol Buffers or some other
serialization library). Note that because AMQP is a binary protocol,
text formats like JSON largely lose their advantage of being easy to
inspect as data travels across the network, so if bandwidth efficiency
is important, consider using `MessagePack <http://msgpack.org/>`_ or
`Protocol Buffers <http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>`_.

A few popular options for data serialization are:

-  JSON
-  BSON
-  `Message Pack <http://msgpack.org>`_
-  XML
-  Protocol Buffers

Message attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RabbitMQ messages have various metadata attributes that can be set when
a message is published. Some of the attributes are well-known and
mentioned in the AMQP 0.9.1 specification, others are specific to a
particular application. Well-known attributes are listed here as options
that Humus AMQP Module takes:

-  ``:persistent``
-  ``:delivery_mode``
-  ``:mandatory``
-  ``:timestamp``
-  ``:expiration``
-  ``:type``
-  ``:reply_to``
-  ``:content_type``
-  ``:content_encoding``
-  ``:correlation_id``
-  ``:priority``
-  ``:cluster_id``
-  ``:user_id``
-  ``:app_id``
-  ``:message_id``

All other attributes can be added to a *headers table*.

An example:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $now = microtime(1);

    $attribs = new MessageAttributes()
    $attribs->setAppId('amqp.example');
    $attribs->setAppId(8);
    $attribs->setType('kinda.checkin';
    $attribs->setHeaders(array(
        'latitude' => 59.35,
        'longituide' => 18.0666667
    ));
    $attribs->setTimestamp($now)
    $attribs->setCorrelationId('r-1');
    $attribs->setContentType('application/json');

    $producer->publish('{"foo": "bar"}', '', $attribs);

   </dl>

It is recommended that application authors use well-known message
attributes when applicable instead of relying on custom headers or
placing information in the message body. For example, if your
application messages have priority, publishing timestamp, type and
content type, you should use the respective AMQP message attributes
instead of reinventing the wheel.

Validated User ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some scenarios it is useful for consumers to be able to know the
identity of the user who published a message. RabbitMQ implements a
feature known as `validated User
ID <http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#validated-user-id>`_. If
this property is set by a publisher, its value must be the same as the
name of the user used to open the connection. If the user-id property is
not set, the publisher's identity is not validated and remains private.

.. note:: Validated user id not yet implemented in Humus AMQP Module.

Publishing Callbacks and Reliable Delivery in Distributed Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A commonly asked question about RabbitMQ clients is "how to execute a
piece of code after a message is received".

Message publishing with Bunny happens in several steps:

-  AMQPExchange::publish takes a payload and various metadata
   attributes
-  Resulting payload is staged for writing
-  On the next event loop tick, data is transferred to the OS kernel
   using one of the underlying NIO APIs
-  OS kernel buffers data before sending it
-  Network driver may also employ buffering

As you can see, "when data is sent" is a complicated issue and while
methods to flush buffers exist, flushing buffers does not guarantee that
the data was received by the broker because it might have crashed while
data was travelling down the wire.

The only way to reliably know whether data was received by the broker or
a peer application is to use message acknowledgements. This is how TCP
works and this approach is proven to work at the enormous scale of the
modern Internet. AMQP 0.9.1 fully embraces this fact and Bunny follows.

In cases when you cannot afford to lose a single message, AMQP 0.9.1
applications can use one (or a combination of) the following protocol
features:

-  Publisher confirms (a RabbitMQ-specific extension to AMQP 0.9.1)
-  Publishing messages as mandatory
-  Transactions (these introduce noticeable overhead and have a
   relatively narrow set of use cases)

A more detailed overview of the pros and cons of each option can be
found in a `blog post that introduces Publisher Confirms
extension <http://bit.ly/rabbitmq-publisher-confirms>`_ by the RabbitMQ
team. The next sections of this guide will describe how the features
above can be used with Bunny.

Publishing messages as mandatory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When publishing messages, it is possible to use the ``:mandatory``
option to publish a message as "mandatory". When a mandatory message
cannot be *routed* to any queue (for example, there are no bindings or
none of the bindings match), the message is returned to the producer.

.. note:: The PHP AMQP Extension currently has not full support of the mandatory flag.

Returned messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a message is returned, the application that produced it can handle
that message in different ways:

-  Store it for later redelivery in a persistent store
-  Publish it to a different destination
-  Log the event and discard the message

A returned message handler has access to AMQP method (``basic.return``)
information, message metadata and payload (as a byte array). The
metadata and message body are returned without modifications so that the
application can store the message for later redelivery.

Publishing Persistent Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Messages potentially spend some time in the queues to which they were
routed before they are consumed. During this period of time, the broker
may crash or experience a restart. To survive it, messages must be
persisted to disk. This has a negative effect on performance, especially
with network attached storage like NAS devices and Amazon EBS. AMQP
0.9.1 lets applications trade off performance for durability, or vice
versa, on a message-by-message basis.

To publish a persistent message, use the ``:persistent`` option:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $attribs = new MessageAttributes();
    $attribs->setPersistent(true);
    $producer->publish($data, '', $attribs);

**Note** that in order to survive a broker crash, the messages MUST be
persistent and the queue that they were routed to MUST be durable.

:ref:`Durability and Message Persistence <durability>` provides more information on the subject.

Publishing In Multi-threaded Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Humus AMQP Module in multi-threaded environments, the rule of thumb is:
avoid sharing channels across threads.

In other words, publishers in your application that publish from
separate threads should use their own channels. The same is a good idea
for consumers.

Headers exchanges
-----------------

Now that message attributes and publishing have been introduced, it is
time to take a look at one more core exchange type in AMQP 0.9.1. It is
called the *headers exchange type* and is quite powerful.

How headers exchanges route messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Example Problem Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best way to explain headers-based routing is with an example.
Imagine a distributed `continuous
integration <http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html>`_
system that distributes builds across multiple machines with different
hardware architectures (x86, IA-64, AMD64, ARM family and so on) and
operating systems. It strives to provide a way for a community to
contribute machines to run tests on and a nice build matrix like `the
one WebKit uses <http://build.webkit.org/waterfall?category=core>`_. One
key problem such systems face is build distribution. It would be nice if
a messaging broker could figure out which machine has which OS,
architecture or combination of the two and route build request messages
accordingly.

A headers exchange is designed to help in situations like this by
routing on multiple attributes that are more easily expressed as message
metadata attributes (headers) rather than a routing key string.

Routing on Multiple Message Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Headers exchanges route messages based on message header matching.
Headers exchanges ignore the routing key attribute. Instead, the
attributes used for routing are taken from the "headers" attribute. When
a queue is bound to a headers exchange, the ``:arguments`` attribute is
used to define matching rules:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'exchanges' => array(
                'header-exchange' => array(
                    'name' => 'header-exchange',
                    'type' => 'headers'
                )
            ),
            'queues' => array(
                'myqueue-1' => array(
                    'name' => 'myqueue',
                    'exchange' => 'header-exchange',
                    'arguments' => array(
                        'os' => 'linux',
                        'x-match' => 'all'
                    )
                ),
                'myqueue-2' => array(
                    'name' => 'myqueue',
                    'exchange' => 'header-exchange',
                    'arguments' => array(
                        'os' => 'osx',
                        'x-match' => 'any'
                    )
                )
            ),
            'producers' => array(
                'my-producer' => array(
                    'exchange' => 'exchanges',
                    'auto_setup_fabric' => true
                )
            )
        )
    );

When matching on one header, a message is considered matching if the
value of the header equals the value specified upon binding. An example
that demonstrates headers routing:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $attribs = new MessageAttributes();

    $attribs->setHeaders(array(
        'os' => 'linux',
        'cores' => 8
    ));
    $producer->publish('8 cores/Linux', '', $attribs);

    $attribs->setHeaders(array(
        'os' => 'osx',
        'cores' => 8
    ));

    $producer->publish('4 cores/OS X', '', $attribs);


When executed, it outputs

.. code-block:: bash

    myqueue-2 received 8 cores/Linux

The myqueue-1 has not matched, because of x-match: all

Matching All vs Matching One
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to bind a queue to a headers exchange using more than one
header for matching. In this case, the broker needs one more piece of
information from the application developer, namely, should it consider
messages with any of the headers matching, or all of them? This is what
the "x-match" binding argument is for.

When the ``"x-match"`` argument is set to ``"any"``, just one matching
header value is sufficient. So in the example above, any message with a
"cores" header value equal to 8 will be considered matching.

Headers Exchange Routing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When there is just one queue bound to a headers exchange, messages are
routed to it if any or all of the message headers match those specified
upon binding. Whether it is "any header" or "all of them" depends on the
``"x-match"`` header value. In the case of multiple queues, a headers
exchange will deliver a copy of a message to each queue, just like
direct exchanges do. Distribution rules between consumers on a
particular queue are the same as for a direct exchange.

Headers Exchange Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Headers exchanges can be looked upon as "direct exchanges on steroids"
and because they route based on header values, they can be used as
direct exchanges where the routing key does not have to be a string; it
could be an integer or a hash (dictionary) for example.

Some specific use cases:

-  Transfer of work between stages in a multi-step workflow (`routing
   slip pattern <http://eaipatterns.com/RoutingTable.html>`_)
-  Distributed build/continuous integration systems can distribute
   builds based on multiple parameters (OS, CPU architecture,
   availability of a particular package).

Pre-declared Headers Exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RabbitMQ implements a headers exchange type and pre-declares one
instance with the name of ``"amq.match"``. RabbitMQ also pre-declares
one instance with the name of ``"amq.headers"``. Applications can rely
on those exchanges always being available to them. Each vhost has a
separate instance of those exchanges and they are *not shared across
vhosts* for obvious reasons.

Custom Exchange Types
---------------------

consistent-hash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `consistent hashing AMQP exchange
type <https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange>`_
is a custom exchange type developed as a RabbitMQ plugin. It uses
`consistent
hashing <http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/consistent-hashing/>`_ to route
messages to queues. This helps distribute messages between queues more
or less evenly.

A quote from the project README:

    In various scenarios, you may wish to ensure that messages sent to
    an exchange are consistently and equally distributed across a number
    of different queues based on the routing key of the message. You
    could arrange for this to occur yourself by using a direct or topic
    exchange, binding queues to that exchange and then publishing
    messages to that exchange that match the various binding keys.

    However, arranging things this way can be problematic:

    It is difficult to ensure that all queues bound to the exchange will
    receive a (roughly) equal number of messages without baking in to
    the publishers quite a lot of knowledge about the number of queues
    and their bindings.

    If the number of queues changes, it is not easy to ensure that the
    new topology still distributes messages between the different queues
    evenly.

    Consistent Hashing is a hashing technique whereby each bucket
    appears at multiple points throughout the hash space, and the bucket
    selected is the nearest higher (or lower, it doesn't matter,
    provided it's consistent) bucket to the computed hash (and the hash
    space wraps around). The effect of this is that when a new bucket is
    added or an existing bucket removed, only a very few hashes change
    which bucket they are routed to.

    In the case of Consistent Hashing as an exchange type, the hash is
    calculated from the hash of the routing key of each message
    received. Thus messages that have the same routing key will have the
    same hash computed, and thus will be routed to the same queue,
    assuming no bindings have changed.

x-random
~~~~~~~~

The `x-random AMQP exchange
type <https://github.com/jbrisbin/random-exchange>`_ is a custom
exchange type developed as a RabbitMQ plugin by Jon Brisbin. A quote
from the project README:

    It is basically a direct exchange, with the exception that, instead
    of each consumer bound to that exchange with the same routing key
    getting a copy of the message, the exchange type randomly selects a
    queue to route to.

This plugin is licensed under `Mozilla Public License
1.1 <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html>`_, same as RabbitMQ.

Using the Publisher Confirms Extension
--------------------------------------

Please refer to :ref:`RabbitMQ Extensions guide <extensions>`

Message Acknowledgements and Their Relationship to Transactions and Publisher Confirms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consumer applications (applications that receive and process messages)
may occasionally fail to process individual messages, or might just
crash. Additionally, network issues might be experienced. This raises a
question - "when should the RabbitMQ remove messages from queues?" This
topic is covered in depth in the :ref:`Queues guide <queues>`, including prefetching and examples.

In this guide, we will only mention how message acknowledgements are
related to AMQP transactions and the Publisher Confirms extension. Let
us consider a publisher application (P) that communications with a
consumer (C) using AMQP 0.9.1. Their communication can be graphically
represented like this:

.. raw:: html

    <pre>
    -----       -----       -----
    |   |   S1  |   |   S2  |   |
    | P | ====> | B | ====> | C |
    |   |       |   |       |   |
    -----       -----       -----
    </pre>

We have two network segments, S1 and S2. Each of them may fail. A
publisher (P) is concerned with making sure that messages cross S1,
while the broker (B) and consumer (C) are concerned with ensuring that
messages cross S2 and are only removed from the queue when they are
processed successfully.

Message acknowledgements cover reliable delivery over S2 as well as
successful processing. For S1, P has to use transactions (a heavyweight
solution) or the more lightweight Publisher Confirms, a
RabbitMQ-specific extension.

Binding Queues to Exchanges
---------------------------

Queues are bound to exchanges. This topic is
described in detail in the :ref:`Queues and Consumers guide <queues>`.

Unbinding Queues from Exchanges
-------------------------------

Queues are unbound from exchanges using. This
topic is described in detail in the :ref:`Queues and Consumers guide <queues>`.

Deleting Exchanges
------------------

Explicitly Deleting an Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exchanges are deleted using the ``AMQPExchange#delete``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    /* @var $exchange \AMQPExchange */
    $exchange->delete();

Auto-deleted exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exchanges can be *auto-deleted*. To declare an exchange as auto-deleted,
use the ``:auto_delete`` option on declaration:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
        'humus_amqp_module' => array(
            'exchanges' => array(
                'header-exchange' => array(
                    'name' => 'header-exchange',
                    'type' => 'headers',
                    'auto_delete' => true
                )
            ),

An auto-deleted exchange is removed when the last queue bound to it is
unbound.

Exchange durability vs Message durability
-----------------------------------------

See :ref:`Durability guide <durability>`

Wrapping Up
-----------

Publishers publish messages to exchanges. Messages are then routed to
queues according to rules called bindings that applications define.
There are 4 built-in exchange types in RabbitMQ and it is possible to
create custom types.

Messages have a set of standard properties (e.g. type, content type) and
can carry an arbitrary map of headers.
